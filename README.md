# The Middle Path Charter

A structural framework for testing the long-term stability of
state, social, and governance rules.

This is not a political manifesto.
This is not an ideological proposal.
It is a rule-failure detection tool.

---

## What This Is

This project provides a rule-testing framework to evaluate whether
a governance system is structurally resilient or prone to
collapse due to:

- Exception normalization
- Interpretive power concentration
- Procedural suspension
- Technological overreach

---

## How to Use

Apply the charter as a test, not as a belief system.

For any rule, policy, or governance mechanism, ask:

- Does it introduce long-term exceptions?
- Does it concentrate interpretive power?
- Does it bypass established procedures?
- Does it shift failure costs away from decision-makers?

If yes → structural failure risk detected.
