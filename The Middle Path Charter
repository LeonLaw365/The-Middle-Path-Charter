The Middle Path Charter (Integrated Edition | v1.0–3.0)

Rule-Stability Testing — Final Found Version

> This document is a structural rule-testing charter. It is not a political manifesto, moral appeal, or ideological program. It does not require belief, rely on goodwill, or presume human virtue.

Its sole purpose: To test whether the rules of a state, society, or governance system can operate long-term without collapsing due to grand narratives, power expansion, or technological abuse.




---

I. The Point of Departure (from Version 1.0)

> Aim too high, and you fall to the middle; aim for the middle, and you fall below.



This Charter does not pursue optimal solutions. Instead, it deliberately defines an upper structural boundary that must not be crossed.

History repeatedly shows:

Disasters do not arise from being insufficiently idealistic

They arise from grand narratives repeatedly breaching structural limits


Thus, the Middle Path is not compromise. It is:

> The only survivable form remaining after all unstable structures are removed.




---

II. Charter Positioning

It does not define “good government”

It does not promise progress, prosperity, or fairness

It does not design social blueprints


It answers only one question:

> Under what conditions does a system inevitably move toward irreversible disaster?



And draws absolute red lines accordingly.


---

III. Core Red Lines (Narrative Boundaries + Testability)

Red Line 1 | Grand Narrative Must Not Breach Structure

Any political, national, religious, security, development, or progress narrative:

May exist

May compete

May fail


But must not:

Suspend established procedures

Expand discretionary authority

Create long-term exceptions

Monopolize interpretive power


> Once breached, the system enters structural failure.




---

Red Line 2 | Procedure Over Correctness

In all public affairs:

> Procedural integrity > correctness of judgment > moral intention



Any outcome that:

Bypasses established procedure, or

Rewrites procedure after the fact


Is invalid even if the result appears correct.


---

Red Line 3 | Freeze of Interpretive Power

No individual, institution, or professional group may:

> Derive sustained advantage from interpreting rules.



Rules may only be:

Executed

Reproduced

Audited


Rules must not be:

Flexibly redefined

Contextually reinterpreted

Exception-handled



---

Red Line 4 | Symmetry Between Authority and Citizens

Operational-level information must be symmetrical

All rules must be:

Visible

Understandable

Reproducible



> What is invisible to citizens must not be possessed by authorities.




---

Red Line 5 | Technological Neutrality

Technology (including AI) may only:

Verify rules

Fix procedures

Record actions


Technology must not:

Predict behavior

Score risk

Classify populations

Guide society


> Once technology participates in judging people, the system enters the risk zone of techno-authoritarianism.




---

Red Line 6 | Automatic Review, Not Discretionary Appeal

Any administrative or systemic outcome must:

Provide a standardized review interface

Automatically enter review once triggered

Be independent of identity, rank, intent, or public opinion


> Review is a system obligation, not a granted favor.




---

Red Line 7 | Preservation of Gray Zones

Provided no clear public risk exists:

> Any action not explicitly prohibited belongs to social self-regulation.



Governance aims to:

Prevent disaster


Not to:

Eliminate uncertainty

Erase all gray areas



---

IV. Rule-Testing Framework (Operational)

The following tests may be applied to any state or social system:

Test 1 | Exception Test

Do long-term exceptions exist?

Can exceptions be automatically terminated?


No → Failure


---

Test 2 | Interpretive Power Test

Can any actor interpret rules?

Does interpretation generate material benefit?


Yes → Failure


---

Test 3 | Procedural Integrity Test

Are procedures suspended during crises?

Is “act first, legalize later” permitted?


Yes → Failure


---

Test 4 | Technology Abuse Test

Does technology predict, profile, or rank individuals?


Yes → Failure


---

Test 5 | Review Accessibility Test

Can ordinary individuals trigger review unconditionally?


No → Failure


---

Test 6 | Cost-Bearing Test

Are the real costs of failure borne by decision-makers?


No → Failure


---

V. Professional Marketism (Bounded Integration)

Acknowledgment

Professional capability must be validated by long-term market payment

Professions that cannot bear real costs lack practical legitimacy


Risks

Guild formation

Information monopolies

Professional–technological oligarchy


Sole Correction Path

> Do not suppress professionals. Do not deify professionals. Freeze interpretive power.




---

VI. Final Statement (The 1.0 Spirit, Fully Realized)

This Charter does not construct utopias

It does not promise the future

It does not attempt to reshape humanity


It guarantees only one thing:

> That a society will not be rapidly pushed into irreversible systemic disaster by human laziness, greed, fear, goodwill, or technological impulse.
